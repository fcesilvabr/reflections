When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  We may use a remote repository for backup purposes but I think itÂ´s best used for collaborative work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Pulling changes manually offers more control on the commit process.
