When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  We may use a remote repository for backup purposes but I think it´s best used for collaborative work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Pulling changes manually offers more control on the commit process.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks can be understood as working copy of a repository in github and is used to keep a 'point-in-time'
		version of the repository.
	Clones are a full-copy of a repository either locally or at github.
	Branches are different paths in the repository used to work in different fronts and can be merged back to the master branch.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	I think the benefit of it is for backup purposes i.e. to commit back to a state you may lose in the path.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	I cannot see anything easier on collaborate without usintg Git/GitHub because it would require a lot of email exchange plus
	with files attached and everyone trying to control the versions, comments, etc...
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	I think that using a separate branch is better when you´re working in a new feature or a different version
	and you want to request others to see it before you merge that into a reliable version in your master branch.
