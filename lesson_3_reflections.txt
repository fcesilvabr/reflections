When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  We may use a remote repository for backup purposes but I think itÂ´s best used for collaborative work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Pulling changes manually offers more control on the commit process.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks can be understood as working copy of a repository in github and is used to keep a 'point-in-time'
		version of the repository.
	Clones are a full-copy of a repository either locally or at github.
	Branches are different paths in the repository used to work in different fronts and can be merged back to the master branch.
