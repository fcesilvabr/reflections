How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It makes the process easier and fast.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It can help to avoid common mistakes and also help in productivity.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros
		You choose the time to commit which sis good, because thinking in terms of logical changes the developr is the best one to decide when to commit
	
	Cons
		You can forget or delay on when to commit
		By having that automatically you may have a lot of different versions to look on (depending on the settings you may have choosen)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because this kind of version control system is more related to situations where it makes sense to consider the interaction between the files like in app development

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git command log may be used to show all the commits weÂ´ve made in our files and Git command diff can show the changes themselves.
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because it gives me the oportunity to undo things, test on different commits, reverse to a previous good version, etc.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Well...now I can say a now a little bit how to use it and I think I could use it in all of my development projects
